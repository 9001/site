# R/a/dio API Documentation
R/a/dio doesn't version its API, but could in future. The current base URL is **`https://r-a-d.io/api`**.
Prepend this to every method here.

# Response types
Every object returned by the API (with the exception of errors, see below) returns two objects: `main` and `meta`.
Meta is a short object returning information about the current request, and available routes (as well as our stream URL).
Responses will only detail the *main* object.


# PUT + DELETE Usage
PUT and DELETE are not available in most browsers, so Symfony2 will obey the `_method` POST parameter, set to either `PUT` or `DELETE` for this.


# Current Info [/]
The main object returns an absolute monster of a response. This is cached every 1 second as it is time-sensitive.
In general you should only really need this API response if you want to make a status display for R/a/dio.
Any keys not mentioned below is either obsolete or subject to change.

# DJ Image [/dj-image/{id}]
The PUT, POST and DELETE methods are authenticated; you can only change an image if it belongs to the user making the call or if the user is a Developer.


## Fetch Image [GET]
This will return the image associated with a dj (or a default image). A 404 is returned if an ID did not match a DJ.

+ Response 200 (image/png)
+ Response 404 (text/html)

## Upload Image [POST]
Upload a file to this URL with the key `image`, and the current user's image will be added
(replaces the current entry in the database with the user's ID instead of just overwriting the file)

+ Response 200


# Last Played [/last-played]
Return as set as big as you like using the `limit` and `offset` GET parameters.
Keep in mind that data is constantly changing and if you fetch data in chunks it could result in either a missing or a duplicated entry.
